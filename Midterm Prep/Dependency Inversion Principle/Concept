Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
Violation: High-level module depends directly on low-level module, making the system rigid and hard to change.
Correction: Introduce abstractions (interfaces) that both high-level and low-level modules depend on.
