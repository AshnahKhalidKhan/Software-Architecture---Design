- Separation of concerns: layering; no coupling; no overlap; each part responsible for separate concern

- Separation of concern = Repository design pattern

- Asbtraction = WHAT a class does
  Implementation = HOW a class does

- Composed object's life is connected to parent's life
  Aggregated object's life is independent of parent's life

- State diagram = State design pattern

- Thin-client:
    e.g. web browsers, ATM, kiosks, 
    application processing + data management done on server,
    preferred where user experience needs to be fast b/c data rendered quickly,
    cons: does not work without internet

- Fat-client:
    e.g. any app that needs to be installed,
    only data management done on server,
    application processing done on client,
    preferred where user experience needs to be fast b/c data rendered quickly,
    cons:
        security compromised cause software can be cracked,
        maintainability i.e. upadting is a problem cause not everyone will install
    
- In 3-tier, each layer is on a separate PROCESSOR. Each processor may or may not be on the same MACHINE.

- 3 tier is easily scalable cause each layer can be hosted separately (completely independent).

- IF SCALABILITY IS THE GOAL, CHOOSE 3-TIER.

- MVC:
    is NOT 3-tier,
    choose when you want separation of concern,
    choose when user interaction updates model but we do not need to show it on view,
    (if view is being updated with change in model, we can still use MVC but it will be complex to mock data for testing),
    main benefit is being able to do unit testing,
    only part of the presentation layer of 3-tier architetcure,
    makes view independent of complex logic,
    model:
        is everything related to management of data,
        classes and entities where data is fetched and set
    view:
        shows/represents data,
        same data may have multiple views,
    controller:
        one controller may correspond to many views,
        connects model and view,
        has NO business logic (buiness logic is applied in Businness layer before passed to controller),
        middleman that takes data from model and gives it to view,
        controller sets data in view


- MVP:
    controller replaced with presenter,
    choose cause view and controller were too tightly coupled in MVC,
    here one presenter corresponds to only one view,
    here model does not set view; here model gives data to presenter and presenter sets view,
    presenter has reference of view,
    cons:
        MVP will have huge presentation layer if SRP not followed properly,
        There will be too many presenters,
        too much coupling between views and presenters


- MVVM:
    Publisher-Subscriber pattern followed,
    1 ViewModel handles many views,
    ViewModel has no reference of view; they are just bound together,
    ViewModel and View are completely independent of eachother,
    all Views become independent of eachotehr so switching between them easier too,
    Data-binding implemented (e.g. in react); page re-rendered whenver data changed only,


- Triggers not good practice cause shifting business logic from code to database.
  Do proper documentation as a solution to this.

- Event-driven Architetcure:
    Events must be indepedent (DECOUPLED) of eachother
    Relates to Publisher-Subscriber pattern
    Events managed ASYNCHRONOUSLY,
    Very scalable (just increase consumers of very popular event);
    Very complex, difficult to debug



# Differences in When to Use MVC, MVP, and MVVM

### No Architecture Pattern
- Use when the screen:
  - Holds no state or business logic.
  - Does not communicate with the Model Layer (no server API call or database interaction).

### MVC (Model View Controller)
- Use when the screen has:
  - One-directional flow of actions, where all interactions affect the Model, but the result does not affect the UI.
  - Simple functionality and does not need to communicate extensively with the Model layer.
- Testing is easier when:
  - Actions are reflected on the UI without waiting for the result.
  - The screen holds minimal logic.

### MVP (Model View Presenter)
- Use when the screen has:
  - Bi-directional flow, where user interactions request something from the Model layer, and the result affects the UI.
  - Limited UI elements affected by updates from the Model Layer.
- Avoid using when:
  - UI updates occur without user interactions.

### MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
- Use when the screen has:
  - Many views that need to subscribe to a data source in the ViewModel.
  - One-directional flow, where events come from the Model Layer and affect the UI without user interactions.
- Considerations:
  - Easier maintenance when dealing with multiple views affected by updates.
  - Learning curve for frameworks like RxJava2, LiveData, Android Binding, Rx Binding.

### General Considerations
- No architecture pattern is inherently better; each has its use cases.
- Consider the nature of the screen, the flow of actions, and the complexity of UI updates.
- Other architecture patterns like VIPER, MVI, MVVM-C, REDUX, FLUX are also available.
